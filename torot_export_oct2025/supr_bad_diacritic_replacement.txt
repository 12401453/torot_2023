͑ => ҅
͆ => ꙯
͗ => ҆

Hex-codes for space and then line-separated pairs:
0xcd 0x91 0x20 0xd2 0x85
0xcd 0x86 0x20 0xea 0x99 0xaf
0xcd 0x97 0x20 0xd2 0x86


The one on the left is the shitty TOROT one that prevents the OCS fonts from displaying the adjacent character correctly; the one on the right is Birnbaum's one that works properly

Also replaced all Russian ы with the Cyrillic ꙑ digraph, since I've tried looking on Birnshit's site for the front-jer version and the only one I found seemed to contradict the manuscript
