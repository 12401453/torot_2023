There's one Latin 'h' letter in both the Cyr. and Glag. versions, but this is mentioned by Kurz as being a "spidery <ch>", so I will convert this to the Unicode Glagolitic spider 'ha'.
Line 2568 took the space out of ((i`` c@lova because it was fucking up my punctuation-adding routine (плачь и скрьжьтъ зѫбомъ)
Line 833 moved the position of the slash back one space because it was clearly wrong (prosv$tEt/ => prosv$tE/t)
similarly line 1394 mn/oDI( and 1703 s$blaznEt(
Lines 46-49: changed three !g!J to !!gJ because there is a titlo on both letters and Lindstedt has broken his own conventions
Line 4780, ) changed to ] because Kurz uses an actual round bracket here
