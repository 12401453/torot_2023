My original list of lemmas contains some sort of lemma_id number, which the Autoreconstructor uses, but the XML files don't because the lemma+POS combination together is enough to uniquely identify each lemma, which means when I extract words from the XML files I can't do much beyond generating a unique lemma_id starting from 1 for each of the words I extract, based on the lemma+POS combined string. This doesn't match my Autoreconstructor's lemma_id numbers, so I have to write a script to identify the mappings between them, but then I get hit with some more bullsh**, which is that in the XML files you've appended #1, #2 etc. to the OCS forms of homonymous lemmas, which isn't the case in the original lemma-list you sent me that I've based all my Autoreconstructor's data on (because that list actually has numerical IDs to do the differentiating).
AND you seem to have added quite a few more of these hashtag-differentiators for previously unrecognised homonymous but different lemmas in the meantime (often because I pointed them out to you, e.g. доити), so the only way I can create a reliable map of my original lemma_id's to the newly-generated XML-source ones is by going manually through all 118 occurrences of these hashtagged forms and then adding this hash-tag to my original lemma-spreadsheet, so that the lemma-form+POS combined string will match what you have in your XML files.
And to make matters worse, your scheme for marking homonymous lemmas with these hashtags isn't even consistent: градъ#2 seems to contrast with plain градъ, but you have миръ#1 and миръ#2.
I can't automate adding the hashtags to my original lemmas-spreadsheet, because I need to manually check how each of the homoforms behaves in the actual text to tell which of the pair I need to be marking with which number.


In summary, XML is a ludicrously inefficient storage-mechanism (24Mb Suprasliensis), and one should avoid using strings for data which is basically just indexes into a finite table (doubtless the actual Ruby on Rails tables store things more sensibly than the XML, but for some reason the arcane magic by which this mythical database can be accessed is forbidden knowledge).
