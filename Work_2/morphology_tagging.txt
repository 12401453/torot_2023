Automatic morphology-tagging and lemmatisation:

The Autoreconstructor program described elsewhere only works on words which are annotated with both a lemmatisation and morphology-tag. The other annotations contained in TOROT (part-of-speech labels, syntactic-relations, information-status labels) are of no direct use to me, since they on their own do nothing to disambiguate phonological forms beyond what is already done by the lemmatisation. The part-of-speech is a property of the lemma; homomorphic lemma-forms, e.g. и < *j 'he' and  и < *i 'and' are disambiguated by the first one having 'Pp' (personal-pronoun) as its part-of-speech label, and the second one 'C-' (conjunction). When forced to work only with the publicly-available XML exports of the TOROT data, which do not contain any numeric lemma_id index into the underlying database-table, but only the OCS lemma-form and part-of-speech as annotations, the combination of form + POS-tag can serve as a unique pointer to the correct entry in the lemma-table. Where more than one lemma shares both a lemma-form (i.e. dictionary-form, such the infinitive for verbs) and a part-of-speech, TOROT sometimes disambiguates them in the underlying table, which surfaces in the XML-exports as the appending of a hastag+integer to the lemma-form, e.g. градъ (<*gordъ) vs градъ#2 (<*gradъ). Often, though, TOROT fails to disambiguate, e.g. just in the Marianus there are nearly 20 verb-lemmas which are used for both members of perfective-imperfective aspectual pairs (class 5.4 imperfectives and class 5.2 perfectivs), because they happen to be homomorphic in the infinitive (a list is given in the "random_errors_encountered.txt file").
