1.) Have to go through my lemma_spreadsheet and rename homonymous lemmas with #1 or #2 according to which lemma from the XML files they correspond to, so that I can make an accurate map of my autoreconstructor's lemma_ids to the new lemma_ids generated from the XML files.

KWrite and even cat'ing to Konsole switches the display of the .csv file when it encounters semitic (left-to-right) text, making it seem as if cell for "inflection type" and the loanword source cell are cut up with each other, but this seems not to actually be an error, just a display quirk
