If the earliest ESl. texts (Izborniki vs Uspensik Sbor. vs Rus. Prav. vs Ostromirovo Ev. etc.) are indexed with LCS reconstructions then we should be able to probe for differences in the extent of the sharping of preceding consonants caused by following /e/ and strong *ь, even if the Jers are assumed not to have fallen yet, and the development of my theorised short /Ä/ archiphoneme


I in the footnote am implicitly making a concrete prediction that ikan'je/akan'e is what eliminates the /o/ (or *Ä still?) from the systems, and causes the secondary wave of changes with a reinterpreted conditioning environment of "under stress and not before soft-consnants" (лицо, дёшево)
