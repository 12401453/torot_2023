Nuorluoto 2006:302 - syas something sensible about non-o-shifted dialects in Russian (s'estra, s'estry) occurring predominantly in the South and thus most likely resulting from a Ukrainian-style lack of palatalisation before *e and then a later adoption of the palatalised /s'/ from neighbouring Russian dialects
    -p.306 a clear statement of his thesis that /e,o/ after soft-consonants merged, which I basically agree with, but overall his argument is completely unstructured and incoherent
Bethin 1998: 100-1 and esp. note 30 on p.277 about Old. Ukr. syllable structure
    -p.109 some argumentation for Ukr still haveing CVS structure (even if the coda can no longer be moraic) because it doesnt have word-final devoicing and often doesnt have voicing-assimilation in clusters which span a syllable-boundary, i.e. vezty vs vesty still contrast, unlike in russian, because the former is syllabified as vez.ty
    -p.80-81 for Ukr.Bel. TRЪT reflexes
Shevelov 1986:530 has a -шомоу ending on his version of the inscription of the cross of Evfrosinija of Polock from 1161
    -p.533 on that publication Shevelov has useful citations of his 1979 book talking about general Ukrainian feature-dating which I can just steal
