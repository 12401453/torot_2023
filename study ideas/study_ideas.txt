1.) As first introductory article: Phonological annotation: whole-manuscript Late Common Slavonic reconstruction as a


1.) vowel-contractions, class 5.4 *-aje- endings in verbs, long adj. *ajego etc.; Marianus tendency to contract the verb ending to /aa/ vs Supr., can this be slotted into Bethin's theories about the tolerance for bimoraic syllables in more central Slavic (cf. the Ukr. long adjective endings, Pol. bać się, stać etc.). Can there be done an completely comprehensive study of the OCS manuscripts in this regard that hasnt already been done

2.) Verb-class innovations esp. in Suprasliensis: жідѣа҅хѫ (autoreconstructor gives this as židaaxǫ so this strange reanalysis of žьdati as a class 1 verb with the imperfect ending stuck directly on the (deviantly lengthened) žid- stem is noteworthy); Supr. also has those imperfect perfectives with habitual meaning

3.) [bit boring] Is Jagić's jer-umlaut real? (there are so many possible environments for it that I doubt a comprehensive study couldve been done in the way that would be piss easy for me)

4.) One possibly dead-end study, but one only possible with my technology, would be one into the three different <i> letters; I use it as a quick demonstration on Marianus


3.1.) One advantage to highlight is how palatalised /ŕĺń/ before /i,e/ etc. can be easily found even when often no orthographic marking all distinguishes these from plain /rln/; especially useful when investigating secondary palatalisation (cf. Shevelov 1964 on the Proto-Ukrainian documents)

2X звѣрѣ spellings in Supr. show moving from masc_i > jo-stems (not an ideal example because palatal /r/ existed already in the system, but still not bad)

Why does OCS show PV2 after *sk in words like ӣю̄деӣстѣӣ, ӣцѣлѧтъ but never in о̄скв̄рънѧт < *skvŕ̥n- ?

4.) Assemanianus: why such shit jers, yet preserved root-aorists, extremely conservative orthography (KF spelling of /y/, occasional jat' after shipjashchiy hanging around, nearly flawless /dz/). If the shitty jers point to a more Northwestern location (like Marianus), why is there no trace of ǫ > /o/, but instead signs of a Bulgarian merger (front-nasal spellings after palatals)?

5.) When I solve the neural-network problem, a dedicated article on that method vs both Rabus' and Eckhoff 2016 and my adaption of Eckhoff's methods needs to be written, using Assemanianus as the test-case

6.) similarly an in-depth study on Assemanianus' phonology and morphology needs to be produced with reference to all previous scholarship on it, using my autoreconstructed data as a secret weapon allowing quick and easy testing of previous claims and discovery of new patterns

7. my class 13 (umerti etc.) imperfects should have non-metathesised full-grade stems оумерѣахъ etc., but these never ever occur, suggesting that a wholesale reshaping which occurred after the (very recent) metathesis. This must have implications for the dating of the rise of the imperfect as a unitary tense; as it must have been newly formed based on the aorist stem (which after metathesis ended on a vowel to which the -ax- imperfect formant could be added). Alternatively, and as might perhaps be suggested from the spellings with unetymological jer (Supr. мь҆рѣꙿхѫ), these imperfects are based on the zero-grade present stem *mŕ̥-, but that in itself would be irregular and a deviance. Diels p.236 has more discussion, where he also mentions the class 16 мелꙗаше (*meĺǢaše) with an unexpected present-stem in the imperfect


8.) Simple study of palatalisation-marks cross-referenced with etymological /ĺŕń/ , to help probe the extent of secondary-palatalisation falling together with LCS palatals in more Eastern dialects

9.) Expansion of Wandl's idea about palatalisation across a weak back-jer caused by the continuing phonemic separateness of LCS *ĺńŕ from secondary /l' r' n'/ (пошлю) (see Google Doc)


9.) An investigations into the extent of the "paradigmatisation" of the hard/soft opposition in East Slavic, specifically by looking at the spellings of vowels after palatal-letters, to see if any sign of the Russian/Belarusian/Polish-type forcing of all consonants into this system as opposed to the Ukrainian allowance of 1.) phonetic softness in otherwise 'hard' post-palatals before /i/ or when geminated, or 2.) phonetic hardness before /e,y/ in otherwise soft /c'/.

жласти жлѣсти - clearly a TORT group loan from Germanic *geld-, so the alternation is either totally artificial or it goes back to hearing the borrowing as either *geld- or *geeld-, then palatalising with PV1 to *želd- or *žǢld-, then *žǢld gets metathesised to *žlad- while *želd- goes to *žlěd-. This is a challenge to the existence of my *Ǣ archiphoneme, because it suggests that *Ǣ before tauto-syllabic /l/ was fully-backed to /a/ *žald- before metathesis. However if we instead assume that the Germanic sound was borrowed singularly as *gee- (or that the long-vowel won out in the period between this pre-PV1 borrowing and the time when the *Ǣ archiphoneme disappeared) then we could actually explain both OCS forms as being respectively Ur- and non-Urkirchenslavisch: жласти would be from an *Ǣ > /a/ dialect that had *žald- > *žlad-, while жлѣсти is from *žělsti > *žlěsti. Of course, this assumes that ECS long /ee, aa/ before tautosyllabic /l/ was capable of remaining long and did not just immediately fall together with its short equivalents, which would mandate us to explain either an *želd or *žold- form (of course *žold- breaks all of LCS phonotactics, so it would appear that the peculiar confluence of phonetics in this Germanic loan present us with a very interesting test-case for the behaviour of long /ee/ after palatals)

Need to find some explanation of расоути - расъпе, (Psal. Sin. расоушѩ кості), because so far I've not found it in bastard Koch's book

Why do l-participles of nasal-stems have nasal-vowels instead of just i.e. požьnlъ, načьnlъ? Was /nl, ml/ disallowed until metathesis reintroduced it in e.g. mlěti? (my autoreconstructor once )

Is the *-tъ extension in some aorist 2nd and 3rd singular forms ACTUALLY the same *-tQ ending as in the present tense verbs? Uspenskij Sbornik has бъість mostly but otherwise usually spells those as -тъ, including поꙗтъ which is already a very long way from any OCS model
