In order to ease the processing of non-TOROT texts which doubtless will contain lemmas outside of the TOROT lemma-list, the lemmas from the dictionary at gorazd.org need to be scraped and matched against the existing TOROT ones, even if it is likely to be a while before they all get LCS reconstructed and inflection-class-marked.
Neural lemmatisation that relies on modifying inflected forms is of limited use to me, because resultant lemmas that do not coincide with things in my lists are of no benefit, no matter how short the "edit-distance" between the guessed-lemma and the correct one might be; surface lemma-forms are irrelevant except insofar as they (combined with the POS-tag) allow lemmas in the list to be uniquely identified. Therefore truly out-of-vocabulary words, meaning words whose lemmas are not in any of my lists, will never be of any use to me even if a lemmatiser can come up with a correct-looking lemma-form for it
