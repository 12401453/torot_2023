коньчьныи in RusPrav looks soft

There are two ⱖ in Suprasliensis, and if you look at whatsisname's version he has:
    1.) тоⱘ [ⱖ] for the first occurence, but the manuscript has ѩ (and admittedly jotated front-nasal is rare in Supr. because usually that distinction is carried by using that weird front-nasal for the non-jotated version) with a possible ⱖ underneath it which has been corrected
    2.) глѫбокъⱖ for the second one, yet when you look at the manuscript there's no hint of the Glagolitic letter and it instead just has глѫбокъѩ (which could easily just be the standard letter for /y/ and the standard letter for Supr-jotated-front-nasal but with a horizontal line connecting them that makes it look like ъ plus another Supr-atypical ѩ occurence).

As came to light from your TnT-normalised ps138.txt file, /y/ in Psal. seems to have been spelt with the two Cyrillic letters <ъі>, whereas normally you render this digraph with the single Cyrillic letter <ꙑ>. I actually always render this letter with the two Cyrillic letters as you seem to have done in Psal., because it is more accurate to the digraphic nature of the underlying Glagolitic and it makes things like normalising the <ъи> spellings of /y/ in Kiev. easier, but you generally do the opposite so this messes up your normalising routines. (Conversely, I used to change all digraphic <оу> into the single letter to more accureately reflect the clearly fused Glagolitic monograph, but I think the way you do it, changing them all to <оу>, is better because of issues around ѵ and single-use of <у>)


You can't have the word негасимъꙇмь lemmatised as гасити; you either separate the не or lemmatise it as негасити


There's a pipe-character in the "presentation-before" field of Psal., which I was using as a .csv separator, so I've changed it to ¬

For some reason there is an "￼ " character in the "presentation-after" field of a token in chrabr.xml (I read on the Syntacticus documentation Unicode code-points from the Private Use Area can be used to encode formatting information, so maybe it's that, but I doubt it)


There's no subtitle <title> element in the pskov.xml or luk-koloc.xml, which fucks up my subtitle-extracting script


Marianus Matt. 21 речета given as 2.dual imperative rather than 2.dual pres. indicative

Some Suprasliensis words have what seems underlyingly to be <я> that shows up as jotated-a under the Menaion font, which is very misleading

Birchbarks 9 инѹю is not marked for strong/wk., so autoreconstructor doesn't stick the article on

Many вьсакъ marked as weak still in ORV (though here the long-adjectives get pronominal endings so it's hard to know what to do)

Inconsistent ORV lemmatisation of pronominals, where sometimes they follow adjectives in being listed in long-form (i.e. +jь) but othertimes not, including the doublets сь and сии

Within the Primary Chronicle some forms of *polmy are marked as nt. and others as masc.; I have this recorded as a masc_N stem (though clearly it moved to neuter in Russian at some point), so the neuter forms get no endings

Psalm 112 Вьселѣѩї неплодъве въ домъ:. Мр҃е о чѩдѣхъ веселѩште сѩ - this seems very confused in all versions but the present solution doesn't concord at all with the forms

*(ni)kotorъ is not marked as weak even when it blatantly has an article //Dealt with by check in Autoreconstructor

some *jedьnъ lemmas are lemmatised as *jedinъ and need to be changed so I no longer have my retarded check for them //Dealt with by check in Autoreconstructor
