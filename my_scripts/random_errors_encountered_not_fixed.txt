коньчьныи in RusPrav looks soft

There are two ⱖ in Suprasliensis, and if you look at whatsisname's version he has:
    1.) тоⱘ [ⱖ] for the first occurence, but the manuscript has ѩ (and admittedly jotated front-nasal is rare in Supr. because usually that distinction is carried by using that weird front-nasal for the non-jotated version) with a possible ⱖ underneath it which has been corrected
    2.) глѫбокъⱖ for the second one, yet when you look at the manuscript there's no hint of the Glagolitic letter and it instead just has глѫбокъѩ (which could easily just be the standard letter for /y/ and the standard letter for Supr-jotated-front-nasal but with a horizontal line connecting them that makes it look like ъ plus another Supr-atypical ѩ occurence).

As came to light from your TnT-normalised ps138.txt file, /y/ in Psal. seems to have been spelt with the two Cyrillic letters <ъі>, whereas normally you render this digraph with the single Cyrillic letter <ꙑ>. I actually always render this letter with the two Cyrillic letters as you seem to have done in Psal., because it is more accurate to the digraphic nature of the underlying Glagolitic and it makes things like normalising the <ъи> spellings of /y/ in Kiev. easier, but you generally do the opposite so this messes up your normalising routines. (Conversely, I used to change all digraphic <оу> into the single letter to more accureately reflect the clearly fused Glagolitic monograph, but I think the way you do it, changing them all to <оу>, is better because of issues around ѵ and single-use of <у>)


You can't have the word негасимъꙇмь lemmatised as гасити; you either separate the не or lemmatise it as негасити


There's a pipe-character in the "presentation-before" field of Psal., which I was using as a .csv separator, so I've changed it to ¬

For some reason there is an "￼ " character in the "presentation-after" field of a token in chrabr.xml (I read on the Syntacticus documentation Unicode code-points from the Private Use Area can be used to encode formatting information, so maybe it's that, but I doubt it)


There's no subtitle <title> element in the pskov.xml or luk-koloc.xml, which fucks up my subtitle-extracting script


Marianus Matt. 21 речета given as 2.dual imperative rather than 2.dual pres. indicative

Some Suprasliensis words have what seems underlyingly to be <я> that shows up as jotated-a under the Menaion font, which is very misleading

Birchbarks 9 инѹю is not marked for strong/wk., so autoreconstructor doesn't stick the article on

Many вьсакъ marked as weak still in ORV (though here the long-adjectives get pronominal endings so it's hard to know what to do)

Inconsistent ORV lemmatisation of pronominals, where sometimes they follow adjectives in being listed in long-form (i.e. +jь) but othertimes not, including the doublets сь and сии

Within the Primary Chronicle some forms of *polmy are marked as nt. and others as masc.; I have this recorded as a masc_N stem (though clearly it moved to neuter in Russian at some point), so the neuter forms get no endings

The single оувѧзати lemma contains forms like о̑увꙙзъшꙙ and о̑увꙙꙁошꙙ, which can only come from оувѧзнѫти, and the PPPs must be from the class 5.2 rather than 5.4 version of оувѧзати, so that also needs adding

млънии is an erroneous duplicated of мльнии (though the ever-retarded SJS lists it with the back-jer as well)

154615|матерехъ|матерехъ|-p---flpsi|4561|251108|| ||||| is lemmatised with the possessive-adj *mateŕь when it's clearly the Lpl. of the fem_R *mati

въздвиѕати is used as the lemma both for class 5.2 and 5.4 variants (вь҆ꙁдвижеши, Вьздвіѕаѩї) and for forms of the lemma въздвигнѫти (въꙁдвиженъ)

Psalm 112 Вьселѣѩї неплодъве въ домъ:. Мр҃е о чѩдѣхъ веселѩште сѩ - all the nominals here are erroneously accusative rather than vocative (and hence get autoreconstructed badly)

Psalm 36 погъіблѭтъ lemmatised as погꙑбнѫти instead of погꙑбати (5.2)

Supr Sabini 13 March живетъ lemmatised as живити

истьлѣти is used for both class 32 истлѣѥть (1X) and class 40 истьлити (3X ист[ьъ]ли)

The back-nasal in the PRAP 180684|движѫште|двіжѫште|-pppamn-si|4364|253926|| ||||| suggests that this should be from the class 5.2 lemma двиѕати rather than the class 3.1 движати (cf. 73895|двіжѩштіѣ|двіжѧштіѣ|-pppann-wi|4364|307194|| |||||)

All of the words lemmatised under нѫждати are just imperfects of нѫдити

голиафъ should be голиадъ

изѩти is obvious duplicate for *jьzęti

83354|объстоѣньѣ|объстоѣньѣ|-s---ng--i|4156|308704||: ||||| is lemmatised under *ostojǢnьje, which obviously is correct, but also this is a reformation based on *obъ so really a separate word

67560|оуньзѫ|оуньзѫ|3paia----i|4159|306113 should be lemmatised under separate *unьznǫti, there's no Ukr./Bel. in the OCS texts

113248|ближикѫ|бліжікѫ|-s---fa--i|4206|247045 needs changing to masculine

*(ni)kotorъ is not marked as weak even when it blatantly has an article

some *jedьnъ lemmas are lemmatised as *jedinъ and need to be changed so I no longer have my retarded check for them

люто as an Adj. is clearly wrong and should probably be changed to лютъ. As a noun it is in the dict. as an S-stem neuter

Psal. Sin. Подрѣжаніе і порѫганіѣ сѫштімъ окръстъ насъ.- first word lemmatised as подрьжати when dict. list it under подражати,подрѣжати meaning "to imitate" or "to mock, jeer at" (second meaning fits here)

сѵриискъ is lemmatised as сѵрьскъ; it should be separate *sürijьskъ

Mar. etc. негасѧ is lemmatised as an adjective, but it surely needs to be a verb негасати; that is what I've marked it as in the reconstruction (ASK permission to relemmatise)

Class 54 variants of the "iskati" verbs (otъmetati etc.) should possibly be added as separate lemmas

All the occurrences of verbs *jьmati *jemĺǫ vs *jьměti *jьmamь in Supr. need to be checked and corrected because this is a huge source of errors
