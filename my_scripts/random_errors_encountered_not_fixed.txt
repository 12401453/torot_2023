коньчьныи in RusPrav looks soft

There are two ⱖ in Suprasliensis, and if you look at whatsisname's version he has:
    1.) тоⱘ [ⱖ] for the first occurence, but the manuscript has ѩ (and admittedly jotated front-nasal is rare in Supr. because usually that distinction is carried by using that weird front-nasal for the non-jotated version) with a possible ⱖ underneath it which has been corrected
    2.) глѫбокъⱖ for the second one, yet when you look at the manuscript there's no hint of the Glagolitic letter and it instead just has глѫбокъѩ (which could easily just be the standard letter for /y/ and the standard letter for Supr-jotated-front-nasal but with a horizontal line connecting them that makes it look like ъ plus another Supr-atypical ѩ occurence).

Why is there a fully-annotated sentence in Psal. in modern Russian from the 1800s? Get rid

As came to light from your TnT-normalised ps138.txt file, /y/ in Psal. seems to have been spelt with the two Cyrillic letters <ъі>, whereas normally you render this digraph with the single Cyrillic letter <ꙑ>. I actually always render this letter with the two Cyrillic letters as you seem to have done in Psal., because it is more accurate to the digraphic nature of the underlying Glagolitic and it makes things like normalising the <ъи> spellings of /y/ in Kiev. easier, but you generally do the opposite so this messes up your normalising routines. (Conversely, I used to change all digraphic <оу> into the single letter to more accureately reflect the clearly fused Glagolitic monograph, but I think the way you do it, changing them all to <оу>, is better because of issues around ѵ and single-use of <у>)

Needless second чародѣи that also only occurs once in Supr.
Your съписати#1 lemma seems to me not to be needed ontop of съпьсати, because yes one infinitive with a lengthened-stem does occur (unless this has just been badly annotated and was not motivated by a perfective-aspect reading), but that is just an expectable deviance. съписати#2 on the other hand is a straight secondary-imperfective class 5.4 and so does have a reason to exist

Needless second срѣда that only occurs once in Supr.
In the master-spreadsheet there's привести#1 привести#2 привести, the latter of which I added myself, and it appears that no-where in the corpus does the #1 lemma occur, suggesting you more recently got rid of it in favour of the plain version. the #2 variant is for the stem ending in -vez instead of -ved, so that's allowed.


You can't have the word негасимъꙇмь lemmatised as гасити; you either separate the не or lemmatise it as негасити


There's a pipe-character in the "presentation-before" field of Psal., which I was using as a .csv separator, so I've changed it to ¬

For some reason there is an "￼ " character in the "presentation-after" field of a token in chrabr.xml (I read on the Syntacticus documentation Unicode code-points from the Private Use Area can be used to encode formatting information, so maybe it's that, but I doubt it)

Zographensis is still full of Latin <x>

Psal. needs its spidery Glagolitic <х> adding back

There's no subtitle <title> element in the pskov.xml or luk-koloc.xml, which fucks up my subtitle-extracting script


Psalm 140 ОУслъішѩтъ сѩ г҃лі моі ѣко възмогѫ. , the last word is tagged as 3rdpl indicative, but isnt it both formally and syntactically a subjunctive / optative?

An incorrect Nb благъ lemma occurs once in Suprs. for what should be the adjective
An incorrect A- нечьсть occurs once in Supr. and twice in Zogr.; in Supr. it is actually the noun нечьсть and in Zogr. it should be the adj нечистъ
вьсꙗко A- once in Zogr. for вьсꙗкъ
мѫчѣница Nb once in Kiev Missal (misspelt lemma)
въкоупьнь A- in KF (misspelt)
съ Pd in KF, Vita Const and Vita Meth (and Supr OLD) seems to be a misspelt duplicate of сь

Kiev Missal такозе wrongly lemmatised as такоже (it is *takoђe)

Vita Method. ч4стьноѥ. It's tagged as чьстьнъ but could conceivably also be частьнъ (given the Ru. Chu. Sl. reflex of front-nasals in this text), but I'm changing it to a ь because this 4 adds an extra character to my base deep-cleaned Chu letter-vocab, which frankly turns my stomach
Vita Const. Pалтирь with Latin <P> is also f**king up my deep-cleaned base letter-vocab so I have replaced it with пс in my training-data but not in the XML file

Marianus Matt. 21 речета given as 2.dual imperative rather than 2.dual pres. indicative
Marianus Luke 12 отвръзѫтъ lemmatised as отъврѣщи

Diels p.231 cites Psal. отъпадѣмъ with a conditional meaning "I would fall down", i.e. 1sg imper.,  whereas Sykes tags it as 1pl. imper (due to the meaningless back-jer)

Psal. Sin. all forms of оущедрѩтъ etc. are lemmatised as оущѣдрити with a jat' instead of <е>. For now I can just reconstruct the lemma correctly but this will need to be moved to the new correct lemma

Some Suprasliensis words have what seems underlyingly to be <я> that shows up as jotated-a under the Menaion font, which is very misleading

Psal. 16. Ѡбѩсѩ мѩ ѣко левъ готовъ на ловъ:. и ѣко скоуменъ обітаѩ во съкровіштіхъ:- first word is I think 3rd pl. sigmatic aorist, but you've lemmatised it as 3sg aor + refl.

2X одеждѫтъ in Psal. lemmatised as the nonsense одеждѫти. Obviously this is just oděti
The second noun (Nb) lemma ѩдро is wrong because you use it for what the dict. lists as nt. pl. ꙗдра 'arms, embrace'

The lemma оумрьщвениѥ should have an epenthetic ĺ in it since it transparently the dejotated verbal-noun of *umŕ̥stviti. The dict. here is retarded since it records the same incorrect form but gives the Russian translation умерщвление that shows the original epenthetic ĺ.

Putting aside the nonsense compromise lemma-form you've given рѫковѩть, this really should be split into 2 lemmas *rǫkojętь and *rǫkovętь, because they are clearly 2 possibilities of consonant-prothesis depending on whether the rounded -o of the first part or the fronted ę- of the second part was considered the more important in occasioning the prothesis. For now I have it as *rǫkovętь because spellings with <в> are more common
Ditto for съвѫзъ

Psal. 3 бл҃гословещвенье is wrongly lemmatised as *bolgoslovešћenьje when clearly it should be *bolgoslovešћvĺenьje (which is also in the dict.)

Many instances of vьxakъ are marked as weak (which is nonsensical since this is a pronominal not an adjective), esp. in the ORV corpus, and this makes my autoreconstructor stick an article onto them (possibly my autoreconstruction logic is flawed here but still marking them as weak is not justified and not consistent). E.g. Birchbarks 9 инѹю is not marked for strong/wk., so autoreconstructor doesn't stick the article on

Inconsistent ORV lemmatisation of pronominals, where sometimes they follow adjectives in being listed in long-form (i.e. +jь) but othertimes not, including the doublets сь and сии

Within the Primary Chronicle some forms of *polmy are marked as nt. and others as masc.; I have this recorded as a masc_N stem (though clearly it moved to neuter in Russian at some point), so the neuter forms get no endings

Supr. непригвожденъ lemmatised as an adjective непригвождьнъ when it's clearly the PPP of *prigvodziti, and thus *neprigvožђenъ

Supr. Paul and Juliana о͑тъ поганъ покаяти lemmatised as *poganyńi

вьнегда is (according to dict. and my reconstruction *vъn+jegъda) a twice-wrong lemmatisation; the correct lemma is also in there -> get rid
сръдъце bad lemma

The lemma you have as masc. стѫпъ only occurs once with the nasal in your corpus, and the dict. instead records a fem. стопа, so this whole lemma and its gender-tags need changing
108108|повиноуѭ̑ is lemmatised as повинѫти when it should be повиновати

Words lemmatised as прильпѣти are a total mess: dict. gives us an additional 3 variants of this word: прильнѫти, прильпати, прилѣпити, and many of the corpus-forms seem to be these instead, e.g. Прільпе is the 3sg aor. of class 21 прильнѫти

form змииню would suggest that the hard-adj lemma змиинъ is being inappropriately used for the jo-stem змиин҄ь

The single оувѧзати lemma contains forms like о̑увꙙзъшꙙ and о̑увꙙꙁошꙙ, which can only come from оувѧзнѫти, and the PPPs must be from the class 5.2 rather than 5.4 version of оувѧзати, so that also needs adding

млънии is an erroneous duplicated of мльнии (though the ever-retarded SJS lists it with the back-jer as well)

154615|матерехъ|матерехъ|-p---flpsi|4561|251108|| ||||| is lemmatised with the possessive-adj *mateŕь when it's clearly the Lpl. of the fem_R *mati

въздвиѕати is used as the lemma both for class 5.2 and 5.4 variants (вь҆ꙁдвижеши, Вьздвіѕаѩї) and for forms of the lemma въздвигнѫти (въꙁдвиженъ)

Psalm 112 Вьселѣѩї неплодъве въ домъ:. Мр҃е о чѩдѣхъ веселѩште сѩ - all the nominals here are erroneously accusative rather than vocative (and hence get autoreconstructed badly)

Psalm 36 погъіблѭтъ lemmatised as погꙑбнѫти instead of погꙑбати (5.2)

Supr Sabini 13 March живетъ lemmatised as живити

истьлѣти is used for both class 32 истлѣѥть (1X) and class 40 истьлити (3X ист[ьъ]ли)

The back-nasal in the PRAP 180684|движѫште|двіжѫште|-pppamn-si|4364|253926|| ||||| suggests that this should be from the class 5.2 lemma двиѕати rather than the class 3.1 движати (cf. 73895|двіжѩштіѣ|двіжѧштіѣ|-pppann-wi|4364|307194|| |||||)

190051|възꙑваю|възъіваю|1spia----i|4049|310072|| ||||| ? check mss.

All of the words lemmatised under нѫждати are just imperfects of нѫдити

голиафъ should be голиадъ

изѩти is obvious duplicate for *jьzęti

83354|объстоѣньѣ|объстоѣньѣ|-s---ng--i|4156|308704||: ||||| is lemmatised under *ostojǢnьje, which obviously is correct, but also this is a reformation based on *obъ so really a separate word

67560|оуньзѫ|оуньзѫ|3paia----i|4159|306113 should be lemmatised under separate *unьznǫti, there's no Ukr./Bel. in the OCS texts

113248|ближикѫ|бліжікѫ|-s---fa--i|4206|247045 needs changing to masculine

*(ni)kotorъ is not marked as weak even when it blatantly has an article

some *jedьnъ lemmas are lemmatised as *jedinъ and need to be changed so I no longer have my retarded check for them

люто as an Adj. is clearly wrong and should probably be changed to лютъ. As a noun it is in the dict. as an S-stem neuter

Psal. Sin. Подрѣжаніе і порѫганіѣ сѫштімъ окръстъ насъ.- first word lemmatised as подрьжати when dict. list it under подражати,подрѣжати meaning "to imitate" or "to mock, jeer at" (second meaning fits here)
