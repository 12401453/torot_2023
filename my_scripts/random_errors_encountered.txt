коньчьныи in RusPrav looks soft

There are two ⱖ in Suprasliensis, and if you look at whatsisname's version he has:
    1.) тоⱘ [ⱖ] for the first occurence, but the manuscript has ѩ (and admittedly jotated front-nasal is rare in Supr. because usually that distinction is carried by using that weird front-nasal for the non-jotated version) with a possible ⱖ underneath it which has been corrected
    2.) глѫбокъⱖ for the second one, yet when you look at the manuscript there's no hint of the Glagolitic letter and it instead just has глѫбокъѩ (which could easily just be the standard letter for /y/ and the standard letter for Supr-jotated-front-nasal but with a horizontal line connecting them that makes it look like ъ plus another Supr-atypical ѩ occurence).

Why is there a fully-annotated sentence in Psal. in modern Russian from the 1800s? Get rid

As came to light from your TnT-normalised ps138.txt file, /y/ in Psal. seems to have been spelt with the two Cyrillic letters <ъі>, whereas normally you render this digraph with the single Cyrillic letter <ꙑ>. I actually always render this letter with the two Cyrillic letters as you seem to have done in Psal., because it is more accurate to the digraphic nature of the underlying Glagolitic and it makes things like normalising the <ъи> spellings of /y/ in Kiev. easier, but you generally do the opposite so this messes up your normalising routines. (Conversely, I used to change all digraphic <оу> into the single letter to more accureately reflect the clearly fused Glagolitic monograph, but I think the way you do it, changing them all to <оу>, is better because of issues around ѵ and single-use of <у>)

Mar. Mat 23 ⱄⱘⱎⱅⰻⰻⰿⰻ is wrongly tagged as dative
Supr. has домаштьнѧѩ which I need to check because I dont think it ever uses the jotated ję and instead differentiates by the shape of the non-jotated small jus

There's a third родити lemma that only occurs in Supr. and seems to mean the same as родити#1
Needless second кръмити that only occurs once in Supr. as кръмивъши,V-,-supafn-si.
Needless second чародѣи that also only occurs once in Supr.
Your съписати#1 lemma seems to me not to be needed ontop of съпьсати, because yes one infinitive with a lengthened-stem does occur (unless this has just been badly annotated and was not motivated by a perfective-aspect reading), but that is just an expectable deviance. съписати#2 on the other hand is a straight secondary-imperfective class 5.4 and so does have a reason to exist
въстѧѕати#1 and въстѧѕати#2 are both used for perf. 5.2 and imperf. 5.4 forms of this verb in Supr., making a mockery of your differentiation of them
Needless second срѣда that only occurs once in Supr.
In the master-spreadsheet there's привести#1 привести#2 привести, the latter of which I added myself, and it appears that no-where in the corpus does the #1 lemma occur, suggesting you more recently got rid of it in favour of the plain version. the #2 variant is for the stem ending in -vez instead of -ved, so that's allowed.

Of the lemmas I had add to differentiate, you've only added 2 (dojiti and urězati); the full list is (I gave the news ones lemma_ids starting from 750000):

(плачь и скрьжьтъ зѫбомъ)

You can't have the word негасимъꙇмь lemmatised as гасити; you either separate the не or lemmatise it as негасити


There's a pipe-character in the "presentation-before" field of Psal., which I was using as a .csv separator, so I've changed it to ¬

For some reason there is an "￼ " character in the "presentation-after" field of a token in chrabr.xml (I read on the Syntacticus documentation Unicode code-points from the Private Use Area can be used to encode formatting information, so maybe it's that, but I doubt it)

Zographensis is still full of Latin <x>

Psal. needs its spidery Glagolitic <х> adding back

There's no subtitle <title> element in the pskov.xml or luk-koloc.xml, which fucks up my subtitle-extracting script

Loads of long-adjectives in your Kiev Folia are marked as strong

камꙑ is marked as neuter in a few places which means it gets reconstructed with no endings, because it should be masculine

Psalm 140 ОУслъішѩтъ сѩ г҃лі моі ѣко възмогѫ. , the last word is tagged as 3rdpl indicative, but isnt it both formally and syntactically a subjunctive / optative?

An incorrect Nb благъ lemma occurs once in Suprs. for what should be the adjective
An incorrect A- нечьсть occurs once in Supr. and twice in Zogr.; in Supr. it is actually the noun нечьсть and in Zogr. it should be the adj нечистъ
вьсꙗко A- once in Zogr. for вьсꙗкъ
мѫчѣница Nb once in Kiev Missal (misspelt lemma)
въкоупьнь A- in KF (misspelt)
съ Pd in KF, Vita Const and Vita Meth (and Supr OLD) seems to be a misspelt duplicate of сь

Kiev Missal такозе wrongly lemmatised as такоже (it is *takoђe)

Vita Method. ч4стьноѥ. It's tagged as чьстьнъ but could conceivably also be частьнъ (given the Ru. Chu. Sl. reflex of front-nasals in this text), but I'm changing it to a ь because this 4 adds an extra character to my base deep-cleaned Chu letter-vocab, which frankly turns my stomach
Vita Const. Pалтирь with Latin <P> is also f**king up my deep-cleaned base letter-vocab so I have replaced it with пс in my training-data but not in the XML file

Marianus Matt. 21 речета given as 2.dual imperative rather than 2.dual pres. indicative
Marianus Luke 12 отвръзѫтъ lemmatised as отъврѣщи

Diels p.231 cites Psal. отъпадѣмъ with a conditional meaning "I would fall down", i.e. 1sg imper.,  whereas Sykes tags it as 1pl. imper (due to the meaningless back-jer)

Psal. Sin. 101 оущедрѩтъ is lemmatised as оущѣдрити with a jat' instead of <е>

Some Suprasliensis words have what seems underlyingly to be <я> that shows up as jotated-a under the Menaion font, which is very misleading

Psal. 16. Ѡбѩсѩ мѩ ѣко левъ готовъ на ловъ:. и ѣко скоуменъ обітаѩ во съкровіштіхъ:- first word is I think 3rd pl. sigmatic aorist, but you've lemmatised it as 3sg aor + refl.

2X одеждѫтъ in Psal. lemmatised as the nonsense одеждѫти. Obviously this is just oděti
The second noun (Nb) lemma ѩдро is wrong because you use it for what the dict. lists as nt. pl. ꙗдра 'arms, embrace'

The lemma оумрьщвениѥ should have an epenthetic ĺ in it since it transparently the dejotated verbal-noun of *umŕ̥stviti. The dict. here is retarded since it records the same incorrect form but gives the Russian translation умерщвление that shows the original epenthetic ĺ.

Putting aside the nonsense compromise lemma-form you've given рѫковѩть, this really should be split into 2 lemmas *rǫkojętь and *rǫkovętь, because they are clearly 2 possibilities of consonant-prothesis depending on whether the rounded -o of the first part or the fronted ę- of the second part was considered the more important in occasioning the prothesis. For now I have it as *rǫkovętь because spellings with <в> are more common
Ditto for съвѫзъ

Psal. 3 бл҃гословещвенье is wrongly lemmatised as *bolgoslovešћenьje when clearly it should be *bolgoslovešћvĺenьje (which is also in the dict.)

Many instances of vьxakъ are marked as weak (which is nonsensical since this is a pronominal not an adjective), esp. in the ORV corpus, and this makes my autoreconstructor stick an article onto them (possibly my autoreconstruction logic is flawed here but still marking them as weak is not justified and not consistent). E.g. Birchbarks 9 инѹю is not marked for strong/wk., so autoreconstructor doesn't stick the article on

Inconsistent ORV lemmatisation of pronominals, where sometimes they follow adjectives in being listed in long-form (i.e. +jь) but othertimes not, including the doublets сь and сии

Within the Primary Chronicle some forms of *polmy are marked as nt. and others as masc.; I have this recorded as a masc_N stem (though clearly it moved to neuter in Russian at some point), so the neuter forms get no endings

Supr. непригвожденъ lemmatised as an adjective непригвождьнъ when it's clearly the PPP of *prigvodziti, and thus *neprigvožђenъ

Supr. Paul and Juliana о͑тъ поганъ покаяти lemmatised as *poganyńi

вьнегда is (according to dict. and my reconstruction *vъn+jegъda) a twice-wrong lemmatisation; the correct lemma is also in there -> get rid
сръдъце bad lemma
The lemma you have as masc. стѫпъ only occurs once with the nasal in your corpus, and the dict. instead records a fem. стопа, so this whole lemma and its gender-tags need changing
108108|повиноуѭ̑ is lemmatised as повинѫти when it should be повиновати
Words lemmatised as прильпѣти are a total mess: dict. gives us an additional 3 variants of this word: прильнѫти, прильпати, прилѣпити, and many of the corpus-forms seem to be these instead, e.g. Прільпе is the 3sg aor. of class 21 прильнѫти
form змииню would suggest that the hard-adj lemma змиинъ is being inappropriately used for the jo-stem змиин҄ь
both ништета and нищета
ꙗвити lemma is duplicate of авити (and only the latter is correct)
The single оувѧзати lemma contains forms like о̑увꙙзъшꙙ and о̑увꙙꙁошꙙ, which can only come from оувѧзнѫти, and the PPPs must be from the class 5.2 rather than 5.4 version of оувѧзати, so that also needs adding
млънии is an erroneous duplicated of мльнии (though the ever-retarded SJS lists it with the back-jer as well)
154615|матерехъ|матерехъ|-p---flpsi|4561|251108|| ||||| is lemmatised with the possessive-adj *mateŕь when it's clearly the Lpl. of the fem_R *mati
въздвиѕати is used as the lemma both for class 5.2 and 5.4 variants (вь҆ꙁдвижеши, Вьздвіѕаѩї) and for forms of the lemma въздвигнѫти (въꙁдвиженъ)

Psalm 112 Вьселѣѩї неплодъве въ домъ:. Мр҃е о чѩдѣхъ веселѩште сѩ - all the nominals here are erroneously accusative rather than vocative (and hence get autoreconstructed badly)
Psalm 36 погъіблѭтъ lemmatised as погꙑбнѫти instead of погꙑбати (5.2)
Supr Sabini 13 March живетъ lemmatised as живити
