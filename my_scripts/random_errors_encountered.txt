Most *pomoћi words seem to be lemmatised with the OCS verb помощи, though you also have помочи listed and occuring twice.
Similarly рещи in RusPrav
коньчьныи in RusPrav looks soft

There are two ⱖ in Suprasliensis, and if you look at whatsisname's version he has:
    1.) тоⱘ [ⱖ] for the first occurence, but the manuscript has ѩ (and admittedly jotated front-nasal is rare in Supr. because usually that distinction is carried by using that weird front-nasal for the non-jotated version) with a possible ⱖ underneath it which has been corrected
    2.) глѫбокъⱖ for the second one, yet when you look at the manuscript there's no hint of the Glagolitic letter and it instead just has глѫбокъѩ (which could easily just be the standard letter for /y/ and the standard letter for Supr-jotated-front-nasal but with a horizontal line connecting them that makes it look like ъ plus another Supr-atypical ѩ occurence).

Why is there a fully-annotated sentence in Psal. in modern Russian from the 1800s? Get rid

As came to light from your TnT-normalised ps138.txt file, /y/ in Psal. seems to have been spelt with the two Cyrillic letters <ъі>, whereas normally you render this digraph with the single Cyrillic letter <ꙑ>. I actually always render this letter with the two Cyrillic letters as you seem to have done in Psal., because it is more accurate to the digraphic nature of the underlying Glagolitic and it makes things like normalising the <ъи> spellings of /y/ in Kiev. easier, but you generally do the opposite so this messes up your normalising routines. (Conversely, I used to change all digraphic <оу> into the single letter to more accureately reflect the clearly fused Glagolitic monograph, but I think the way you do it, changing them all to <оу>, is better because of issues around ѵ and single-use of <у>)

Mar. Mat 23 ⱄⱘⱎⱅⰻⰻⰿⰻ is wrongly tagged as dative
Supr. has домаштьнѧѩ which I need to check because I dont think it ever uses the jotated ję and instead differentiates by the shape of the non-jotated small jus

There's a third родити lemma that only occurs in Supr. and seems to mean the same as родити#1
Needless second кръмити that only occurs once in Supr. as кръмивъши,V-,-supafn-si.
Needless second чародѣи that also only occurs once in Supr.
Your съписати#1 lemma seems to me not to be needed ontop of сьпьсати, because yes one infinitive with a lengthened-stem does occur (unless this has just been badly annotated and was not motivated by a perfective-aspect reading), but that is just an expectable deviance. съписати#2 on the other hand is a straight secondary-imperfective class 5.4 and so does have a reason to exist
въстѧѕати#1 and въстѧѕати#2 are both used for perf. 5.2 and imperf. 5.4 forms of this verb in Supr., making a mockery of your differentiation of them
Needless second срѣда that only occurs once in Supr.

Of the lemmas I had add to differentiate, you've only added 2 (dojiti and urězati); the full list is (I gave the news ones lemma_ids starting from 750000):

You can't have the word негасимъꙇмь lemmatised as гасити; you either separate the не or lemmatise it as негасити
