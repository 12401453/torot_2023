Fixed all Kiev Folia spelling errors

(lemma changes do not apply to Supr. OLD because I left that text untouched)

changed all the non-numbered родити to родити#1  (some bits of Supr. I wasn't entirely sure that I understood the meaning fully so I might've had to use #2 instead)

changed all ништета lemmas to нищета

changed all ꙗвити lemma to авити

changed some neuter-tagged камꙑ to masculine

added an отъкръвениѥ lemma because only 2 окръвениѥ's occur vs 4 отъкръвениѥ, and while I know the latter is just a reshaping with the prep. *otъ-k vs *otk > *ok, such a reformation has to be Common Slavic because they are not synchronically phonologically equivalent at all (plus you already have отъкрꙑти and отъкрꙑвати lemmas)

changed the 2 моштьнъ lemmas to мощьнъ

changed the strength-marking of long-adjectives in KF to weak
changed the "свѧтъі" in дазь намъ. да свѧтъі твоі въсѫдъ пріемлѭце достоіні бѫдемъ очішчениѣ твоего to acc. sg. wk., because it has the wrong spelling for *-y ending and the tagging was masc. nom. pl. which would be *-i anyway, and the syntax makes no sense unless it's masc. sg. acc.

removed all Latin <x> from Matt 3,4,5 of Zographensis

put ⱒ back into Psal. everywhere that Kempgen (2016) mentions it being

changed lemmatisation of Vita Methodii 1 хълⸯмъ from the weird хълмъ lemma (which was otherwise only used for the scribal-error Glagolitic omega <ѻ> containing word for 'hill' in Psal. Sin. thought to be a mix-up with spider Glagolitic <ⱒ>), such that this lemma should now be deleted

fixed lemmatisation of words lemmatised as прильпѣти or прилѣпитъ: changed many to прильнѫти or прильпати, e.g. Zogr. Luke 10 прилепъшеи (this one had caused bad auto-lemmatisation in Assem.)

changed Psal. lemma оумѫдрѣти to оумѫдрꙗти because it is an imperfective of оумѫдрити meaning 'to make wise', and doesn't have a stative/becoming meaning so can't be class 32, and this is what dict. does too

changed 2 Psal. Sin одеждѫти lemmas to одѣти
