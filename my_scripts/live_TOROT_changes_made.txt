Fixed all Kiev Folia spelling errors

(lemma changes do not apply to Supr. OLD because I left that text untouched)

changed all the non-numbered родити to родити#1  (some bits of Supr. I wasn't entirely sure that I understood the meaning fully so I might've had to use #2 instead)

changed all ништета lemmas to нищета

changed all ꙗвити lemma to авити

changed some neuter-tagged камꙑ to masculine

added an отъкръвениѥ lemma because only 2 окръвениѥ's occur vs 4 отъкръвениѥ, and while I know the latter is just a reshaping with the prep. *otъ-k vs *otk > *ok, such a reformation has to be Common Slavic because they are not synchronically phonologically equivalent at all (plus you already have отъкрꙑти and отъкрꙑвати lemmas)

changed the 2 моштьнъ lemmas to мощьнъ

changed the strength-marking of long-adjectives in KF to weak
changed the "свѧтъі" in дазь намъ. да свѧтъі твоі въсѫдъ пріемлѭце достоіні бѫдемъ очішчениѣ твоего to acc. sg. wk., because it has the wrong spelling for *-y ending and the tagging was masc. nom. pl. which would be *-i anyway, and the syntax makes no sense unless it's masc. sg. acc.

removed all Latin <x> from Matt 3,4,5 of Zographensis

put ⱒ back into Psal. everywhere that Kempgen (2016) mentions it being

changed lemmatisation of Vita Methodii 1 хълⸯмъ from the weird хълмъ lemma (which was otherwise only used for the scribal-error Glagolitic omega <ѻ> containing word for 'hill' in Psal. Sin. thought to be a mix-up with spider Glagolitic <ⱒ>), such that this lemma should now be deleted

fixed lemmatisation of words lemmatised as прильпѣти or прилѣпитъ: changed many to прильнѫти or прильпати, e.g. Zogr. Luke 10 прилепъшеи (this one had caused bad auto-lemmatisation in Assem.)

changed Psal. lemma оумѫдрѣти to оумѫдрꙗти because it is an imperfective of оумѫдрити meaning 'to make wise', and doesn't have a stative/becoming meaning so can't be class 32, and this is what dict. does too

changed 2 Psal. Sin одеждѫти lemmas to одѣти

changed the morphology of Ѣко бренье пѫті поглаждѫ ѩ because it blatantly follows the Septuagint in everything except "road" being Gsg. instead of Gpl., whereas the original annotations were nonsensical

cleaned up съпьсати съписати#1 съписати#2 nonsense by replacing all the #1 occurrences with съпьсати and controversially changing the infin. "съписати" in Supr. to съпьсати, since this is semantically perfective and explainable by the common deviance of full-grade stems encroaching upon the zero-grade stems. The leftover съписати#2 does deserve to exist as the class 5.4 secondary-imperfective, but it no longer needs to be differentiated numerically

Psal. 104 changed поіте lemmatisation to пѣти (from поити) because Septuagint has ψαλατε here presumably from ψαλλω 'to twang'
Added lemma ѫдолиѥ for Psal. 64 Ї ѫдольѣ оумьножѩтъ пъшеніцѫ

Changed Psal. 17 потоці lemmatisation to потокъ (from потопъ), because Septuagint has χείμαρροι which means 'torrents' apparently

Changed lemmatisation of two words in this Supr. sentence: хоштете ли и͑ о͑тъ камыка сего о̑услышати. и͑же вами чьстенъ я͑ко прѣльштаѥ͑те сⱕ

Changed ручьи in Igor's Campaign from fem. to masc.

Changed Usp. Sborn. начьнꙗше to načęti (from načinati)

Added нарицати#2 for the class 52 (or 51, we can't tell) version, e.g. Supr. наричѫ, and corrected the incorrect lemmatisations of these forms as нарешти

Changed Psalm 136 тоуждеї from fem. loc. weak to strong
