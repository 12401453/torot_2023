гончар 'potter' is apparently from gr̥nъčǢrъ
phrase "ясен пень" has short-form of ясный with an inserted /e/, but Derksen pg.153 reconstructs this as *ěsnъ (i.e. *jǢsnъ)

I'm using a tilde ~ to mark secondary-palatalisation in the inflection-tables

The plural oblique forms of око have the PV1 reflex from the *-es- infix in them (очах etc.), which is only specifiable at the LCS stage if I make their desinences *jǢxъ etc., which is not historically accurate in any way

I've put the modern Russian PV3 endings in an extra {303,} table, because I'm worried about their being Russian words which don't undergo PV3, and what's in the 302 column is mostly the original hard o/a-stem endings

всякий just becomes an adjective; тъ becomes more like a Russian pronominal but is reduplicated in nom.; neither can be accounted for easily by a secondary pron-hard table

I should add a separate table for adjectives and just put the ancestors of the modern Russian pronominal-dervied and short-form endings in there, rather than keeping them on the o/a-stem table

An interesting question is: what happens to the dual-forms of adjectives as the endings are being replaced with the pronoun-ones?

Extra Inflection desinence_idx's for the extra verb-forms I produce are as follows (had to have 100 added to them or else they will overlap with the extra forms of byti):
    145: masc. sg. long-form PRAP (ведущий etc.)
    146, 147, 148: fem, nt, and plural l-participle forms (вела вело вели)
    149: perfective verbal adverb *-(v)ъši forms (ведши, наступивши etc.)
