гончар 'potter' is apparently from gr̥nъčǢrъ
phrase "ясен пень" has short-form of ясный with an inserted /e/, but Derksen pg.153 reconstructs this as *ěsnъ (i.e. *jǢsnъ)

I'm using a tilde ~ to mark secondary-palatalisation in the inflection-tables

The plural oblique forms of око have the PV1 reflex from the *-es- infix in them (очах etc.), which is only specifiable at the LCS stage if I make their desinences *jǢxъ etc., which is not historically accurate in any way

I've put the modern Russian PV3 endings in an extra {303,} table, because I'm worried about their being Russian words which don't undergo PV3, and what's in the 302 column is mostly the original hard o/a-stem endings

всякий just becomes an adjective; тъ becomes more like a Russian pronominal but is reduplicated in nom.; neither can be accounted for easily by a secondary pron-hard table

I have added a separate table for adjectives and just put the ancestors of the modern Russian pronominal-dervied and short-form endings in there, rather than keeping them on the o/a-stem table

An interesting question is: what happens to the dual-forms of adjectives as the endings are being replaced with the pronoun-ones?

Extra Inflection desinence_idx's for the extra verb-forms I produce are as follows (had to have 100 added to them or else they will overlap with the extra forms of byti):
    145: masc. sg. long-form PRAP (ведущий etc.)
    146, 147, 148: fem, nt, and plural l-participle forms (вела вело вели)
    149: perfective verbal adverb *-(v)ъši forms (ведши, наступивши etc.)


CSR match тиверцы needs to be тиверец to match the Wiktionary lemma

About 5 uninflectable lemmas from the spreadsheet get included if I switch off the "hasFinalJer" check: tvṝdo bṛzo naprasno dḹgo prisno

I'm getting rid (setting the 'annotated' column of the Google Drive spreadsheet to blank) of отъврести and отъврещи because for one, only the first actually corresponds to CSR отверзть, and they aren't in my lemma-spreadsheet so presumably they were added after 2023, and they are retarded forms anyway as they should have jats in them (unless the ORV lemmatisation-policy is to write all Ch.Sl. TerT groups with <е>, which it surely can't be). It will also be a pain to force zero-grade ablaut throughout the paradigm of these verbs which is what I'd need to do to match Ru. отверзть

Got rid of присно and присьныи as it's likely there was never a jer in these

Removed the non-numbered спасти from the Google Drive spreadsheet since that was total bullshit when I looked it up on TOROT ('save' is #1 and 'fall' is #2)
