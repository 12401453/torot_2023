the class 6 смечу etc. forms of сметати aren't listed anywhere on Russian wiktionary but are on English wiktionary

Russian Wiktionary lists only угр with no угрин singular forms (Engl. Wiktionary does)

азбука goes from fem_uu to fem_a which is not accounted for

два inflection-table isn't marked normally so none of that got took

полтора

двое
