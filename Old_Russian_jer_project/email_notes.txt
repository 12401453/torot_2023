-- I haven't yet decided how to deal with the North-Slavic o-stem instr. sg. ending *-ъmь, and opposed to *-omь, but I don't think the exclusion of this will matter since it always ends up as -ом anyway.
-- One of my alternatives endings for o-stems and similar is the u-stem Instr. pl. *ъmi ending, which I don't think ever survives into modern Russian, so this somewhat inflates the number of lemmas viewed as having a non-final jer "somewhere in the paradigm".
-- I choose to add one long-form adjectival to the produced paradigms, viz. the nom. masc. sg. by adding *jь, but this then makes basically every single adjective contain a non-final jer, and since the reflexes of these are mostly entirely predictably and morphologically-determined, this could be seen as pointless. It's useful for tracking forms in TOROT texts, though

A thing I would do for the actual project is update my inflectional-morphology to be Russian-focused, i.e. exclude possible deviances that are OCS-specific and potentially add more Russian-specific ones (like jo-stem alternatives for i-stems)

I should also expand the list of the lexemes that show the Common Slavic *je- *o- alternation (один, озеро etc.) because that ""change"" is not predictable (Andersen's actually quite terrible book on it should be enough)

It's in this format because that's easier for me to play with using Javascript in the browser-console

When I automatched my OCS-lemma-based LCS reconstructions to the TOROT lemmas I did mark those which required an OCS conversion to match, and so I have applied a different conversion to those, which means the doublets in TOROT like боронь / брань get converted to my OESl. /boronь/ and /branь/ respectively.
