There's one Latin 'h' letter in both the Cyr. and Glag. versions, but this is mentioned by Kurz as being a "spidery <ch>", so I will convert this to the Unicode Glagolitic spider 'ha'.
Line 2568: took the space out of ((i`` c@lova because it was fucking up my punctuation-adding routine (плачь и скрьжьтъ зѫбомъ)
Line 833: moved the position of the slash back one space because it was clearly wrong (prosv$tEt/ => prosv$tE/t)
similarly line 1394 mn/oDI( and 1703 s$blaznEt(
Lines 46-49: changed three !g!J to !!gJ because there is a titlo on both letters and Lindstedt has broken his own conventions
Line 4780, ) changed to ] because Kurz uses an actual round bracket here
Line 568, got rid of the brackets in [k]o[!c] because it prevents it being recognised as punctuation and is bloody annoying
line 2994: changed chapter from 97 to 7
line 5216: similarly changed the verse index from 4112210 to 4122210, because this was an incorrect chapter 11 in the middle of chapter 12
line 4879: changed verse-index from 4082020 to 4092020, because this was an incorrect chapter 8 in the middle of chapter 9
