The displayed TITUS text is an absolutely disgracefully simplified version of the original ASCII-textfile: All the digraph front-nasals have been replaced with the monographic version (in Cyr. all ѩ has been replaced with ѧ), and in Cyrillic (but not Glagolitic) the ꙇ letter has been replaced with і. плачь и скрьжьтъ зѫбомъ

Most Slavic /u/ is spelt with two separate Cyrillic letters оу, but the letter in foreign words that reflect /ü/ is spelt with the ѹ digraph. This is an absolutely disgusting practice because Kurz's edition uses ѵ, and the only Glagol. letter possible here is ⱛ, which some see as the second component of ⱆ, so your choices for Cyrillicisation are either ѵ or у; I prefer the first choice and so does Kurz so that's what should be done, not using a completely misleading digraph that looks identical to оу. (Lindstedt's ASCII-file uses capital U for Kurz's ѵ)
Even worse, spelling Glag. ⱛ with the Cyrillic оу digraphic has had a knock-on effect on the reGlagoliticisation, which now renders /u/ with Glagolitic <ⱁ> + <ⱆ>, when the whole point of the latter Glagolitic letter is it's already a digraph of <ⱁ> and  <ⱛ>, so the
