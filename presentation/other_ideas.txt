The Bulgarians have """"ditigised"""" these Izborniki but the PDFs they have made accessible are encoded in such a way that it's literally impossible to convert the underlying text in them to unicode; they may as well have just taken photographs of printed-out paper

Psalterium Sinaiticum лицѣ, apparently Lsg. (-s---nl--i) but without the expected (analogical?) jo-stem ending. Either this is mis-tagged and should be NApl. with jat' spelling of /a/ (cf. чѣшѣ etc. in this ms.), or it's vindication of the traditional and Kortlandt-supported PV3-last theory, because it shows that the (strictly-speaking non-phonologically motivated) adoption of the jo-stem endings was analogical and thus liable not wholly consistently carried out. If Lunt (the shit) was right, the Lsg. ending here would've been fronted before the monophthongisation of diphthongs during the CS 'Umlaut' (*oi > *ei > /i/) and there'd be no possibility of a jat' here.
